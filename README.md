This Git Repo hosts the HTML/CSS and JavaScript that is used on the website https://logan-schindler.github.io/ 

This website acts as a personal portfolio to present projects that I have done.

To get the website working I learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript by taking two courses from Free Code Camp and earned two certificates from completing the courses.
